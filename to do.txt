Propaganda

- player navigates a city - or each level is a city?
	- top-down-ish view

- goal is to spread "the cause" to the city
	- city is full of folks wandering around
	- also enemies - bureaucrats, cops, army

- weapons:
	leaflets
	megaphone
	money



to do (bare minimum):

- capitalists
	- fire money - implemented
	- converted by money - implemented

	- when their money hits a commie, converts him back to a civilian - implemented

- powerups
	- ammo - leaflets, money, megaphones


- levels and level loader

- score & lives
	- score implemented
	- hit points implemented

- win condition (for a level/for game)
- lose condition

- sound

to do (nice)
	- other bad guys
		- bureaucrats - implemented
		- cops
		- soliders
	
	- megaphone
		- like leaflet (converts civilians), but in 8 directions - implemented
		- if it hits a bureaucrat, they come after you - implemented

to do, day 3:

- level design & navigation
- death / game over
- title / instruction screen
- music
